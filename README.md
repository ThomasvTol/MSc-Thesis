## MSc. Thesis project: Uncertainty of COVID in mobility

This respository presents the materials developed during the MSc. Thesis project.

It includes the developed System Dynamics model and the corresponding data files. As Well as the code for model calibrating and the code for the implementation of the SD model in the EMA Workbench.

N.B. To run the Vensim model both the xls data files require to be in the same directory as the model file. Data files will be merged in next stage.  


The data folder contains also the extendend version of the excel file with the background calculations used for model input.
